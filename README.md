# 📄 PDF Chat Assistant using RAG

**FastAPI · LangChain · FAISS · BM25 · Groq**

An intelligent **document question–answering and summarization web application** that allows users to upload documents and interact with them using **natural language queries**.

The system uses a **hybrid retrieval approach (semantic + keyword search)** combined with **LLM-based reasoning** to generate **accurate, context-aware, and streamed responses** strictly grounded in the uploaded document.

## 🧪 Usage Flow

1. Upload a document (PDF / DOCX / TXT / MD)
2. Wait briefly while the document is processed in the background
3. Enter a natural language query
4. Receive **live streamed answers** grounded in the document
5. Ask **follow-up questions** without re-uploading the file

---

## 🔍 Retrieval Strategy

* Combines **semantic understanding** (FAISS) with **keyword precision** (BM25)
* Merges top results from both retrievers
* Cleans extracted text to remove:

  * Figure references
  * Table mentions
  * Section numbering
* Sends only the **most relevant chunks** to the LLM for efficiency and accuracy
